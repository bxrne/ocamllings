Learning OCaml through small coding challenges that are fun and practical.

## Problems

#### Compression 
- [x] Run-Length Encoding (RLE) – encode and decode sequences
- [ ] Delta Encoding – store differences between consecutive numbers
- [ ] Simple Huffman Encoding – compress text based on character frequency

#### Streams & Lazy Evaluation
- [ ] Lazy Fibonacci Sequence - Implement an infinite, lazily evaluated Fibonacci sequence using OCaml streams
- [ ] Stream Filtering - Implement a lazy Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers
- [ ] File Streaming - Read a file line-by-line as a lazy stream, processing each line incrementally

#### Parsing & Serialization 
- [ ] CSV Parsing - Write a parser that reads and serializes CSV files into OCaml records
- [ ] Custom JSON Serializer - Implement JSON serialization for a simple data type without external libraries
- [ ] INI Parser - Parse a basic INI configuration file using combinator functions

#### Data Structures 
- [ ] Immutable Stack and Queue - Implement purely functional stack and queue with OCaml lists
- [ ] Persistent Binary Search Tree - Write insert/find/delete for a persistent BST
- [ ] Trie (Prefix Tree) - Build and query a trie for word lookup

#### Data Analysis 
- [ ] Windowing Average - Compute rolling averages over a time series with a fixed window size 
- [ ] K-Means Clustering - Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm for 2D space
- [ ] Linear Regression - Fit a simple linear regression model to a set of 2D points
- [ ] PCA (Principal Component Analysis) - Reduce dimensionality of a dataset using Principal Component Analysis 
- [ ] Monte Carlo Simulation - Estimate the value of Pi using Monte Carlo methods 
- [ ] Black-Scholes Option Pricing - Implement the Black-Scholes formula for European options
